### Veriked: A Wicked Tribute

For a limited time, Veri is renamed Veriked, inspired by the legendary Broadway musical Wicked, now a celebrated major motion picture. This tribute mirrors the intertwined journey of Elphaba and Glinda, two friends whose identities were shaped not by who they truly were but by how the world chose to interpret them. Their story reminds us how easily truth can twist, blur, or break when information goes unverified.

Veriked channels this theme into purpose by blending the misunderstood resilience of the Wicked Witch of the West with the illuminating clarity of Glinda the Glorified Good Witch. It honours the world of Oz, the emerald shimmer, the drifting pink bubbles, the swirling magic, the soaring melodies, and the timeless idea that perception often masquerades as reality.

Through this special edition, Veri embraces the symbolism of Oz to highlight a simple truth: behind every interaction lies a story, and behind every story lies a signal that must be trusted.

Veri’s mission remains the same at its core: to make digital interactions trustworthy by default, strengthened with a touch of narrative, symbolism, and magic. Even in a world full of noise, the truth doesn’t need to defy gravity to rise.
